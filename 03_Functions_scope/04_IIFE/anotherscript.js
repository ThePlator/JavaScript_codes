// Function Challenges 

/* 
Challenge 1
Instructions:

Create a function called getCelsius() that takes a temperature in Fahrenheit as an argument and returns the temperature in celsius.

For bonus points, write it as a one line arrow function

Expected Result:

console.log(getCelsius(32)); // 0
You can make the output look prettier by putting it into a string. You can even add \xB0 (degrees) and a C in front of the celsius temperature.

console.log(`The temperature is ${getCelsius(32)} \xB0C`);
// The temperature is 0 Â°C
Hints:

The formula for Fahrenheit to Celsius is (F - 32) * 5 / 9. Read more about the formula here if needed.


Challenge 2
Instructions:

Create an arrow function called minMax() that takes in an array of numbers and returns an object with the minimum and maximum numbers in the array.

Expected Result:

console.log(minMax([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]));
// { min: 1, max: 5 }
Hints:

1. You can use Math.min() and Math.max() to get the min and max of a list of numbers.
2. You can use the Spread ... operator to spread the values of an array into separate arguments.


Challenge 3
Create an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) that takes in the length and width of a rectangle outputs it to the console in a message as soon as the page loads.

Expected Result:

// On page load
The area of a rectangle with a length of 10 and a width of 5 is 50.
Hints:

1. The area of a rectangle is length * width. These should get passed into the IIFE as arguments.
2. You do not have to return anything from this function, just log to the console.

//Challenge 1

function getCelsius(F){
    return (F-32)*5/9;
}

console.log(`The temperature is ${getCelsius(32)} \xB0C`);


// Challenge 2

function minMax(arr){
    const min = Math.min(...arr);
    const max = Math.max(...arr);
    return {min, max};
}

console.log(minMax([55, 32, 43, 54, 65, 76, 87, 98, 109]));

// Challenge 3


((length, width) => {
const area = length * width;

const output = `The area of a rectangle with a length of ${length} and a width of ${width} is ${area}.`;

console.log(output);
})(10, 5);
